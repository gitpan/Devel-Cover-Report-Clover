NAME
    Devel::Cover::Report::Clover - Backend for Clover reporting of coverage
    statistics

SYNOPSIS
     cover -report clover

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a Clover compatible coverage xml file which can be
    used in a variety of continuous integration software offerings.

    It is designed to be called from the `cover' program distributed with
    Devel::Cover.

OPTIONS
    Options are specified by adding the appropriate flags to the `cover'
    program. This report format supports the following:

    outputfile
        This will be the file name that you would like to write this report
        out to. It defaults to clover.xml.

    projectname
        This is simply a cosmetic item. When the xml is generated, it has a
        project name which will show up in your continuous integration
        system once it is parsed. This can be any string you want and it
        defaults to 'Devel::Cover::Report::Clover'.
